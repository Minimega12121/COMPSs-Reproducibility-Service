    # Description
    Matrix multiplication is a binary operation that takes a pair of matrices and produces another matrix.

    If A is an n×m matrix and B is an m×p matrix, the result AB of their multiplication is an n×p matrix defined only if the number of columns m in A is equal to the number of rows m in B. When multiplying A and B, the elements of the rows in A are multiplied with corresponding columns in B.

    In this implementation, A and B are square matrices (same number of rows and columns), and so it is the result matrix C. Each matrix is divided in N blocks of M doubles (N hardcoded to 2, and M hardcoded to 8). The multiplication of two blocks is done by a multiply task method with a simple three-nested-loop implementation. When executed with COMPSs, the main program generates N^3^ tasks arranged as N^2^ chains of N tasks in the dependency graph.

    # Reproducibility
    To reproduce the exact results of this example, follow the instructions at the [Workflow Provenance section at COMPSs User Manual](https://compss-doc.readthedocs.io/en/stable/Sections/05_Tools/04_Workflow_Provenance.html)

    # Execution instructions
    Usage:
    ```
