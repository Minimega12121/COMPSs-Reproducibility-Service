  name: Monte Carlo Simulation for Pi Estimation 
  description: Small program using PyCOMPSs to perform a Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the value of Pi. The idea is to randomly generate points in a unit square and count how many fall inside the unit circle. The ratio of the points inside the circle to the total number of points gives an approximation of Pi/4.
